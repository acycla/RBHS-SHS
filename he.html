            <p>The HE (Home Economics) strand is dedicated to fostering practical skills and knowledge related to home
                management, family, and consumer sciences. Students explore various aspects of nutrition, culinary arts,
                textiles, and family resources.</p>

            <p>HE students gain hands-on experience in cooking, sewing, and other domestic skills. They learn about
                healthy
                living, budgeting, and effective family management, preparing them for roles in homemaking and related
                fields.</p>
