                The fresh men and sophomore classes were housed temporarily in the Plaridel Col lege Building.<br><br>
                From Plaridel College. the school was transferred to another site which is currently occupied by the Rosales North Central 
                School where Quonset Buildings vacated by the American Soldiers were then used as classrooms.<br><br>
                While classes were going on, the founding fathers and the PTA ne gotiated for the purchased of a permanent site, meticulously chosen be cause of its healthful environment that is conducive to learning,

                late Mr. Alejandro Pablo regarding the contemplated purchase of his lot situated in the Poblacion of Rosales.<br><br>

                it is not just a ingesting of ideas but it is more one practical matter, 
                the of learning today is more on hands-on-minds-on process it focusses on out 
                come based wherein in all things that they have learned must put into action.<br><br>
