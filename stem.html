        <p>The STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) strand is an interdisciplinary field that
            integrates these four key areas to solve complex real-world problems. Students in STEM programs gain a deep
            understanding of scientific principles, technological innovations, engineering processes, and mathematical
            concepts.</p>

        <p>STEM education emphasizes hands-on learning and critical thinking skills. Students engage in projects and
            activities that encourage creativity, collaboration, and problem-solving. This strand prepares individuals
            for
            a wide range of careers, from research and development to technological innovation and engineering design.
        </p>

        <p>With a focus on practical applications, STEM graduates are well-equipped to address the challenges of the
            modern world. Whether it's developing new technologies, designing sustainable solutions, or advancing
            scientific knowledge, individuals with a background in STEM contribute significantly to the progress of
            society.</p>

        <p>STEM education opens doors to diverse career opportunities, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Research Scientist</li>
                <li>Doctor</li>
